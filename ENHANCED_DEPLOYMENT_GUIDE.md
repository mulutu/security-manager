## 🛡️ **Security Operations**

### **Threat Response Procedures**

#### **SSH Brute Force Attack**
```bash
# Automatic Response (by rules engine):
# 1. Detection: 5+ failed SSH attempts from same IP
# 2. Mitigation: Automatic IP blocking for 30 minutes
# 3. Alert: Notification sent to security team

# Manual Investigation:
# Check blocked IPs
sudo iptables -L INPUT -n | grep DROP

# Review attack details
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT * FROM alerts 
WHERE rule_id = 'ssh_brute_force' 
  AND ts > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY ts DESC
"

# Check mitigation results
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT * FROM mitigations 
WHERE action = 'block_ip' 
  AND ts > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY ts DESC
"
```

#### **Suspicious Process Detection**
```bash
# Automatic Response:
# 1. Detection: Suspicious process patterns (nc, python -c, etc.)
# 2. Alert: Immediate notification
# 3. Optional: Process termination (if configured)

# Manual Investigation:
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT * FROM alerts 
WHERE rule_id = 'process_anomaly' 
  AND ts > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY ts DESC
"

# Review process events
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE stream = 'process' 
  AND message LIKE '%suspicious%'
  AND ts > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY ts DESC
"
```

#### **System Resource Abuse**
```bash
# Automatic Response:
# 1. Detection: CPU > 90%, Memory > 90%, Disk > 85%
# 2. Alert: Resource usage warnings
# 3. Optional: Process investigation and termination

# Manual Investigation:
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT 
    host_id,
    cpu_usage,
    memory_usage,
    disk_usage,
    ts
FROM system_metrics 
WHERE (cpu_usage > 90 OR memory_usage > 90 OR disk_usage > 85)
  AND ts > now() - INTERVAL 1 DAY
ORDER BY ts DESC
"
```

### **Incident Response Playbooks**

#### **Critical Security Alert Response**
1. **Immediate Actions (< 5 minutes)**
   - Verify alert in ClickHouse dashboard
   - Check if automatic mitigation was successful
   - Isolate affected host if needed: `ssh host "sudo iptables -P OUTPUT DROP"`

2. **Investigation (< 30 minutes)**
   - Collect forensic data from affected host
   - Review security events leading to alert
   - Determine attack vector and scope

3. **Containment (< 1 hour)**
   - Implement additional blocking rules if needed
   - Update detection rules to prevent similar attacks
   - Coordinate with affected system owners

4. **Recovery (< 4 hours)**
   - Remove temporary restrictions once threat is contained
   - Apply security patches if vulnerabilities were exploited
   - Update security policies and procedures

#### **Service Outage Response**
```bash
# Check service health
curl -v http://178.79.139.38/health

# Restart services if needed
ssh user@178.79.139.38
cd ~/security-manager/deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

# Check agent connectivity
sudo systemctl status security-manager-agent
sudo systemctl restart security-manager-agent

# Verify data flow
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT COUNT(*) as recent_events 
FROM events 
WHERE ts > now() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE
"
```

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Enhanced Features**

### **Agent Issues**

#### **Enhanced Collectors Not Working**
```bash
# Check collector status
sudo journalctl -u security-manager-agent -n 100 | grep -E "(Starting|Failed).*monitoring"

# Common issues and fixes:
# 1. Permissions for systemd journal
sudo usermod -a -G systemd-journal security-manager

# 2. Missing tools for system metrics
sudo apt install -y procps net-tools

# 3. File permissions for auth logs
sudo chmod +r /var/log/auth.log
sudo chmod +r /var/log/secure
```

#### **Mitigation Commands Not Working**
```bash
# Check mitigation listener
sudo journalctl -u security-manager-agent -n 50 | grep -i mitigation

# Check iptables permissions
sudo iptables -L INPUT -n

# Verify agent can receive commands
go run tools/test_enhanced/main.go -ingest 178.79.139.38:9002
```

### **Rules Engine Issues**

#### **Rules Not Triggering**
```bash
# Check rules engine logs
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml logs ingest | grep -i "rules\|alert"

# Verify event patterns
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT message, COUNT(*) 
FROM events 
WHERE ts > now() - INTERVAL 1 HOUR
GROUP BY message
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10
"

# Test specific rule patterns manually
echo "Failed password for root from 192.168.1.100 port 22 ssh2" | grep -E "Failed password for .* from ([0-9.]+)"
```

#### **Mitigations Not Executing**
```bash
# Check NATS command subjects
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8222/jsz" | jq '.streams[] | select(.config.name == "LOGS")'

# Verify command delivery
docker-compose -f deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml logs ingest | grep -i "command sent"

# Check agent command reception
sudo journalctl -u security-manager-agent -n 50 | grep -i "command\|mitigation"
```

### **Performance Issues**

#### **High Resource Usage**
```bash
# Check agent resource usage
ps aux | grep sm-agent
systemctl status security-manager-agent

# Optimize collector intervals (edit agent config)
# Reduce system metrics collection frequency
# Adjust log tailing buffer sizes

# Check service resource usage
docker stats --no-stream
```

#### **Slow Detection Response**
```bash
# Check NATS message processing
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8222/jsz" | jq '.streams[].state'

# Verify ClickHouse performance
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "
SELECT 
    event_date,
    COUNT(*) as events_per_day
FROM events 
WHERE event_date >= today() - 7
GROUP BY event_date
ORDER BY event_date DESC
"

# Optimize ClickHouse if needed
curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8123/" -d "OPTIMIZE TABLE events"
```

---

## 📈 **Scaling Considerations**

### **Horizontal Scaling**

#### **Adding More Service Nodes**
```bash
# Deploy additional ingest services
# Update load balancer configuration
# Configure NATS clustering
# Set up ClickHouse replication
```

#### **Agent Scaling**
```bash
# Current capacity: ~1000 agents per service node
# Monitor NATS connections: curl -s "http://178.79.139.38:8222/connz"
# Monitor ClickHouse insert rate: Check system.metrics table
```

### **Performance Optimization**

#### **ClickHouse Tuning**
```sql
-- Optimize table settings for high-volume ingestion
ALTER TABLE events MODIFY SETTING max_insert_block_size = 1048576;
ALTER TABLE events MODIFY SETTING min_insert_block_size_rows = 524288;

-- Add materialized views for common queries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW events_summary
ENGINE = SummingMergeTree()
ORDER BY (org_id, stream, toDate(ts))
AS SELECT
    org_id,
    stream,
    toDate(ts) as event_date,
    count() as event_count
FROM events
GROUP BY org_id, stream, event_date;
```

#### **NATS Tuning**
```bash
# Increase NATS limits in docker-compose.prod.yml
# max_connections: 10000
# max_payload: 8MB
# max_pending: 256MB
```
